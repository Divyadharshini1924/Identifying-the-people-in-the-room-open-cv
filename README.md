# Identifying-the-people-in-the-room-open-cv
 This project uses OpenCV and deep learning to detect and identify individuals in a room from video or images. By leveraging facial recognition and object detection models (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch), it processes streams, identifies people, and tracks their presence. It's adaptable for security, attendance systems, and smart environments.
